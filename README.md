# Hexa(is)gone

This README is a list of things that i want (or not?) in my game.

It will be divided in multiples sections so that you can look at what you prefer.



## Roadmap

#### Map
- Hexagone.
    - Only for the ground.
    - Other things such as trees, rocks, minerals, etc... will have their own low poly model.
- An "infinite" world would be nice but for now, i don't really know how to do that.
- If not an infinite world, i would like a round world (a planet).

#### Jobs/Crafting
- Jobs giving you bonus stat the more you practice them.
    - Giving levels to jobs?
    - I prefer giving stats based on how many times you do something.
- Better reward if all-in on one job (one job > jack of all trade).
- I would like to permit players to do what they want. Crafting a specific item based on what they want, etc... => Being as free as possible.

- List of possible jobs:
    - Lumberjack (Strengh)
    - Miner (Strengh)
    - Armorer (Strengh + Dexterity)
    - Weaponsmith (Strengh + Dexterity)
    - Toolsmith (Strengh + Dexterity)
    - Hunter (Strengh(?) + Agility)

#### Player
- No global level for players. (No "Level 150 XxDarkSasukexX")
    - Like said before, I prefer jobs/activity levels.
- Possibility to "claim" lands so that you can prevent gried on a specific zone.
- Possibility to custom skin?
- Stats:
    - Strengh
    - Agility
    - Dexterity
    - Speed?
    - Resist?
    - Vitality

#### Pets
- Pets is a must in a game like that.
    - like dogs/horses that are used to help players.
    - like cats, useless but cute.
        - Or do i turn every pets in useful ones giving buff to players.
